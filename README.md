# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project is part of a Machine Learning Lab exercise focused on predicting housing prices in California using real-world data. The dataset includes various socioeconomic and geographic features such as income, location, population, and proximity to the ocean.
The workflow demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

Data fetching and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering and transformation

Categorical encoding and scaling using pipelines

Model training using Linear Regression

Performance evaluation with RMSE

The project follows the steps from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron and is implemented in Python (Colab) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Hello and Welcome

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
